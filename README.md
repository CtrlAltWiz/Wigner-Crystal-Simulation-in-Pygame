## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

**Ensure you have the following installed:**

    Python 3.x
    Pygame
    NumPy

**You can install the dependencies via pip:**

    pip install pygame numpy

## Running the Simulation

**Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/CtrlAltWiz/Wigner-Crystal-Simulation-in-Pygame.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**

    cd Wigner-Crystal-Simulation-in-Pygame

**Run the simulation:**

    python Wigner_CrystalSim_PyGame.py

## Modifying the Parameters

You can modify the simulationâ€™s behavior by changing values in the script such as:

**- Particle count:** Modify the number of particles *(using num_dots)* for performance tuning or to observe different behaviors.

**- Interaction strength:** *(using pygame.time.wait(1))* Adjust how strongly particles interact, affecting the crystal structure.

**- Grid size:** Resize the resolution grid to simulate different scales.

*Most of these parameters are located at the top of Wigner_CrystalSim_PyGame.py for easy access.*

## Understanding Wigner Crystals

A Wigner crystal is a phase of matter that forms when electrons or other charged particles interact strongly enough at low densities, causing them to arrange into a lattice to minimize their potential energy. This simulation offers a simplified 2D model of this behavior, showcasing the fascinating properties of this crystal structure.
